This example demonstrates a common mistake when working with mutable variables in F#.  The `swap` function, seemingly designed to swap two values, fails to do so correctly because F# mutable variables are passed by reference. This means that the function modifies the original variables directly, instead of creating local copies. The solution shows how to use a different approach to correctly swap the values.
